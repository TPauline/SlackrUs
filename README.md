# SlackrUs

Originally a group project, for which I created additional modifications to make it a Personal Project. The group version is also on gitHub here : https://github.com/PurePureMilk/Slackr

App Description: This application students to connect with other students to be study partners, tutors, peer mentors, or form a study group. The goal of this application is to build a sense of community of people in college and overcoming the barriers of social distancing. The main feature of this application is its matchmaking feature such as the stack of cards used in popular matchmaking apps. This feature is used to ease the choice anxiety of users when faced with a list of people to contact. Not only that, helping the user focus on just one card on the stack can help the person understand the person what to get to know better. From there, the user can weed out certain people they are not interested in this organized fashion. How users get to know each other is by making profiles. Users are required to make an account and have the necessary valid information.
